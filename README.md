This app uses a machine learning model called TextBlob under the hood. It looks at the structure and meaning of the sentence, not just individual words, and gives a sentiment score that we convert into positive, negative, or neutral.
WARNING:
This app uses a basic ML model, so it doesn’t understand meaning, sarcasm, threats, or slang — just word scores. More advanced models like ChatGPT can handle this better.
